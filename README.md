Hi, my name is Brandon Oden. I develop applications and interfaces for various platforms and devices. Right now you could call me a Node.js developer with a preference for the MERN stack.  

If you notice the website doing anything strange, relax, it's probably an easter egg.  
Thank you for visiting.
